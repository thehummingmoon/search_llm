Problem Statement:
1. Scrape some category of businesses in a particular area (maybe your city) from Google.
2. Clean and store this in a db, preferably SQL but MongoDB is also ok.
3. Assume that we have a bot where users can search for relevant products or services. Use an LLM to convert the user's input into a search query.
4. This search query needs to be passed to the db so that relevant businesses are picked. You can simulate the search according to the business you picked.
